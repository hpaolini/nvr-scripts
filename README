I use these scripts to capture my surveillance feeds 24/7 using ffmpeg, and split them in 5 minutes segments.

On a Windows system you only really need `cleanup.pl` and `record.pl`--you may have the operating system schedule a daily task to run both programs.

On a Unix-based system you need `cleanup.sh`, `cleanup.pl`, and `record.sh`. You just need to start the two Bash scripts at boot-time.

Don't forget to download ffmpeg and configure the approriate paths inside the scripts.
